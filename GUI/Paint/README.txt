This assignment was pretty open-ended:

We were given a list of tools to copy the functionality of from Microsoft Paint (the tools you'll see in the application), we were only required to have a few colors available, fill colors didn't matter.

I took it a little further in some aspects, but didn't invest any time in this project after it was due and have no intention of revisiting it.
